# CAMP WITH US

This project was created as final group project in college.

## Description of project

Our task was to create a responsive web application for mobile devices using Bootstrap. The application was to be created based on the UML use case diagram and the application prototype. It was also required to use the Firebase database - write, read, data management. User authentication was to be ensured using a login and password, as well as any social network account. Additionally, the use of mobile device functionality using the API available in HTML was scored - in our case it was the use of vibration in the event of an error and full screen on photos. The application was also to be made in line with the Progressive Web App.

## My responsibilities

My main tasks were to coordinate the work of all group members, create and manage a board in Trello, create a UML diagram, connect to Firebase and user authorization.

It looks like we handled everything perfectly, because not only we didn't lose a single point, we even gained a few extra ones.

## Description of app

In our application you can choose 3 methods of logging in - authentication using a login and password, google or facebook account. After logging in, you can browse our offer of tents, select and reserve one of them at the selected date, if it is available. In addition, you can also subscribe to the newsletter to not miss information about promotions and the latest news. If you don't have internet access, don't worry, the application will load thanks to PWA and you will be able to view it or add it as a widget to your screen. However, booking a tent must be done online. Enjoy yourself.
