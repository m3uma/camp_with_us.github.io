# CAMP WITH US

This project was created as final group project in college.

**[CHECK ORIGINAL REPO!](https://github.com/jttim23/Aurora)**

## Description

Our task was to create a responsive web application for mobile devices using Bootstrap. The application was to be created based on the UML use case diagram and the application prototype. It was also required to use the Firebase database - write, read, data management. User authentication was to be ensured using a login and password, as well as any social network account. Additionally, the use of mobile device functionality using the API available in HTML was scored - in our case it was the use of vibration in the event of an error and full screen on photos. The application was also to be made in line with the Progressive Web App.

My main task was to coordinate the work of all group members, create a UML diagram, connect to Firebase and user authorization.

It looks like we handled everything perfectly, because not only we didn't lose a single point, we even gained a few extra ones.
